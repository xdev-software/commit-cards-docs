Favor composition over inheritance whenever possible. **Inheritance creates tight coupling between classes** and can make your code rigid and hard to maintain. **Composition lets you build complex behavior by combining small, focused objects**, keeping your code flexible and testable.

For example, instead of inheriting a `Printer` class to add logging:

```java
class LoggingPrinter extends Printer {
    @Override
    public void print(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logging: " + message);
        super.print(message);
    }
}
```

Use composition to combine behaviors:

```java
class Printer {
    public void print(String message) {
       //Print with actual printer
    }
}

class Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logging: " + message);
    }
}

class LoggingPrinter {
    private final Printer printer;
    private final Logger logger;

    public LoggingPrinter(Printer printer, Logger logger) {
        this.printer = printer;
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void print(String message) {
        logger.log(message);
        printer.print(message);
    }
}
```

Composition keeps each class focused, reduces coupling, and makes it easy to swap implementations or add new behaviors. Inheritance should only be used when a strict “is-a” relationship exists and cannot be expressed via composition.

Before every commit, review your design: could composition replace inheritance? This simple habit leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and more flexible codebases.
