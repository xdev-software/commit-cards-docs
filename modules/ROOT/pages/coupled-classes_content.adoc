When two classes are **tightly coupled, any change in one forces changes in the other**. This makes your code fragile, hard to reuse, and painful to maintain. The goal is to **reduce these dependencies so each class can evolve on its own**.

A common way to break this dependency is to code against interfaces instead of concrete implementations. That way, you depend on behavior, not on a specific class.

For example, instead of this:

```java
public class OrderService {
    private final EmailSender emailSender = new EmailSender();

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // save order
        emailSender.send(order);
    }
}
```

Here, `OrderService` is married to `EmailSender`. If you ever want to send a notification via SMS or push message, you must touch `OrderService`.

A better way:

```java
public interface Notifier {
    void send(Order order);
}

public class OrderService {
    private final Notifier notifier;

    public OrderService(Notifier notifier) {
        this.notifier = notifier;
    }

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // save order
        notifier.send(order);
    }
}
```

Now `OrderService` does not care if the notification is email, SMS, or something else. You can reuse it in many contexts, and testing becomes trivial.

Decoupling makes your code more modular, testable, and flexible. Each time you commit, ask yourself: *If I change this class, how many others break with it?* If the answer is "too many," you probably have coupling that needs to be reduced.
