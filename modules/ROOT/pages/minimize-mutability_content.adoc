Immutable objects are your safest friend in Java. When fields don’t change after creation, reasoning about the code becomes predictable, thread-safe, and bug-resistant. Make fields `private` and `final`, provide no setters, and avoid exposing internal references that could be modified. Prefer `final` classes unless inheritance is truly needed.

Instead of this mutable class:

```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }
}
```

Use a Java record to make it immutable and concise:

```java
public record User(String name, int age) { }
```

This automatically makes fields `private` and `final`, generates a constructor, and provides getter methods (`name()` and `age()`) without setters. The object cannot be modified after creation.

Practical rules:

* Use immutable collections or wrap them in `Collections.unmodifiableList`.
* Avoid setters unless there’s a compelling reason.
* Prefer constructing new objects over modifying existing ones.
* Consider records for simple data carriers  - they are immutable by default and reduce boilerplate.

Every commit should ask: *“Could this object be modified unexpectedly elsewhere?”* If yes, rethink its design. Minimizing mutability makes code safer, easier to reason about, and reduces subtle bugs that even experienced developers stumble upon.
