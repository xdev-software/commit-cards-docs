Every time you touch code, treat it like a mini cleanup mission. If something is messy, confusing, or inconsistent, fix it before committing. Even if it works, **leaving “broken windows” - smelly code, unclear names, duplicated logic - signals to your team that shortcuts are acceptable**. This multiplies over time and drags the whole project down.

In Java, this could be renaming unclear variables, extracting methods, or removing dead code. For example, instead of leaving a long, confusing method:

```java
public void process(Data d) {
    if(d != null) {
        // complicated nested logic
    }
}
```

Refactor it into clear, readable pieces:

```java
public void process(Data data) {
    if (data == null) return;
    validate(data);
    transform(data);
    persist(data);
}
```

Even small cleanups count: consistent formatting, proper exception handling, removing commented-out code, and following naming conventions. This principle isn’t about perfection, it’s about setting a standard every time you touch the codebase. It protects your team from technical debt and makes future changes faster and safer.

Before every git commit, ask: “If someone read this in isolation, would it be clear, safe, and consistent?” If not, clean it. Small, continuous improvements build a culture of quality and make your life and your team’s life dramatically easier. Clean code spreads. Broken windows spread too. Choose wisely.
