Exceptions are signals that something went wrong. Ignoring them is like pretending a car’s warning light isn’t on - you might get lucky once, but eventually it will crash. *Always handle exceptions meaningfully: log them, wrap them, or rethrow them so someone can respond.*

Bad example:

```java
try {
    processOrder(order);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ignored
}
```

Swallowing exceptions hides problems and makes debugging nearly impossible. Bugs silently accumulate and create unpredictable failures.

Better example:

```java
try {
    processOrder(order);
} catch (IOException e) {
    logger.error("Failed to process order {}", order.getId(), e);
}
```

Here, the exception is logged with context which gives maintainers visibility and traceability.
A valid alternative would be to throw a custom exception like this: `throw new OrderProcessingException("Unable to process order", e);`
With this a higher function could handle the exception more specifically and less generalised.

If logging or rethrowing is not needed immediately, at least add a comment explaining why it’s safe to ignore. Otherwise, treat every exception as valuable information about a potential problem.

Every time you commit, check: *Am I ignoring an exception? If so, what is the safe and meaningful way to handle it?* Handling exceptions properly reduces hidden bugs, improves stability, and makes your code more reliable.
