Always make sure every resource you open gets properly closed. Files, database connections, network streams, threads - anything that holds system resources must be released. Forgetting to do this leads to memory leaks, locked files, or crashed services. Think of it as cleaning up after yourself: *if you opened it, you close it*.

In Java, the simplest way is *try-with-resources*. Any class that implements `AutoCloseable` can be safely closed automatically:

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// reader is automatically closed here
```

If you canâ€™t use try-with-resources, always close resources in a `finally` block to guarantee cleanup:

```java
Connection conn = null;
try {
    conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
    // work with the connection
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (conn != null) {
        try { conn.close(); } catch (SQLException ignored) {}
    }
}
```

A good rule: every commit should leave your code in a state where no resource can leak. Treat `close()` as important as writing your main logic. Over time, this habit avoids subtle bugs, improves reliability, and makes your code easier to maintain. Clean, predictable, safe  - every time.
