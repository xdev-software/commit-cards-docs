Refactoring is about improving code structure, readability, and safety without changing behavior.
Every time you touch code, ask: *“Can this be clearer, safer, or easier to maintain?”*
Focus on removing duplication, updating outdated practices, and fixing potential runtime issues.

Consider this old code that prints directly to the console and ignores null safety:

```java
public class UserService {
    public void printUserDetails(User user) {
        System.out.println("User ID: " + user.getId());
        System.out.println("Name: " + user.getName());
    }
}
```

This is fragile: `user` could be `null`, and `System.out.println` is not suitable for real applications.
Refactor it to improve safety and maintainability:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class UserService {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    public void printUserDetails(User user) {
        if (user == null) {
            log.warn("Attempted to print details of a null user");
            return;
        }
        log.debug("User ID: {}", user.getId());
        log.debug("Name: {}", user.getName());
    }
}
```

Now the code is null-safe and uses proper logging instead of printing to the console.

Practical refactoring habits:

* Replace temporary or debug code (`System.out.println`) with proper logging.
* Always check for `null` or invalid inputs before using objects.
* Extract repeated logic into helper methods when necessary.
* Use meaningful log messages to make debugging easier.

Every commit should leave the code safer, more readable, and easier to maintain.
Refactoring isn’t just cleanup - it’s about preventing future bugs and making the code clearer for everyone who works with it.
