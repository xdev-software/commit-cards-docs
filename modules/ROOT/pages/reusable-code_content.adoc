Reusable code is code that can be easily used in multiple places without extra effort. If reusing your code is painful, developers will copy-paste or write it again, which leads to duplication, bugs, and maintenance headaches. Strive for modular, clear, and configurable components.

For example, instead of hardcoding a file path or format:

```java
public class ReportGenerator {
    public void generateReport(List<String> data) {
        // always writes to "/tmp/report.txt"
        try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("/tmp/report.txt")) {
            for (String line : data) {
                writer.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Refactor it to be reusable:

```java
public class ReportGenerator {
    public void generateReport(List<String> data, Path outputFile) {
        try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(Files.newBufferedWriter(outputFile))) {
            for (String line : data) {
                writer.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to generate report", e);
        }
    }
}
```

Now it’s flexible  - you can generate reports to any location without changing the code.

Practical habits for reusability:

* Accept parameters instead of hardcoding values.
* Keep methods focused on a single task.
* Avoid tight coupling with other classes or frameworks.
* Provide clear and consistent interfaces.
* Make it easy to extend or customize without modifying the core logic.

Every commit should ask: *“Could someone use this in a different context easily?”* If not, consider refactoring. Reusable code saves time, reduces bugs, and improves consistency across your codebase.
